            <p>The chart above demonstrates the frequency of a given fatality over a period of 10 years. It is clear that there has been a slight overall increase. However, that does not mean there are not other factors that play into it. For example, improper training on equipment could explain this increase. Safety protocols and procedures are enforced to reduce the number of injuries in the workplace.</p>

            <p>Workplace injuries are harmful to employees and employers because of reduced labor and the cost of medical expenses. In 2022, most injuries were caused by transportation accidents, exposure to harmful substances, and contact with object or equipment. Employers pay for workers' compensation, but it also means they need someone to fill in. Even though workplace injuries have become less common, it is still important employers create a safe working environment to prevent injuries.</p>
